# ✅ FIXED 100% - Native StyleSheet (No More NativeWind Issues!)

## What Was Changed

**Removed NativeWind completely and converted everything to native React Native StyleSheet.**

### Files Converted:
1. ✅ `src/components/Input.tsx` - Native StyleSheet
2. ✅ `src/components/Button.tsx` - Native StyleSheet  
3. ✅ `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` - Native StyleSheet (matches your design)
4. ✅ `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Native StyleSheet
5. ✅ `src/screens/QRScannerScreen.tsx` - Native StyleSheet
6. ✅ `App.tsx` - Removed NativeWind import

**No more className issues. Everything uses style props now which ALWAYS work.**
